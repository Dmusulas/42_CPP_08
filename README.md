# 42 C++ Module 08

This module focuses on the STL (Standard Template Library), containers, algorithms, and iterators.

## Concepts
- STL Containers (`std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::stack`, etc.).
- Iterators.
- STL Algorithms (`std::for_each`, `std::find`).

## Exercises
- **ex00 (Easy find):** A template function to find an integer in a container.
- **ex01 (Span):** A class that stores numbers and calculates the shortest and longest span between them using algorithms.
- **ex02 (Mutated abomination):** Making `std::stack` iterable by inheriting from it (creating `MutantStack`).

## Usage
```bash
cd ex01
make
./span
